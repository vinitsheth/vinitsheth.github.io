### Who am I

My name is Lei Mao. I am a master student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. My research interests are mainly in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

<br />

Before I went to the University of Chicago, I was a PhD candidate in the Department of Biochemistry at Duke University. I also graduated with a bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from Dalian University of Technology in China.

<br />

I am a perfectionist. I want to solve the problems in my hands in perfect ways, which is, however, not achievable in many situations.

### Career Change

I believe I am a true scientist. However, I was not convinced that biology could be considered as "science" at the current level of human civilization when I was at Duke University. That is part of the motivations which causes me to leave this field. I should be thankful that I have learned math and programming well in college, and I met machine learning when I was at the lowest point of my life. 

<br />

With the help from MOOC, I was able to quickly catch up. I have done a good number of elementary machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence and data science projects indepedently. So I would like to challenge myself more by doing some state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence researches.

### About This Site

This website was formally built in the spring of 2017, but the style of the site has been changed several times. 

<br />

The main purposes of this website are listed here:
* Discuss the math and the technical details of machine learning and computer science theories
* Document the implementation of algorithms to solve real problems
* Present my independent research projects
* Record my personal achievements
