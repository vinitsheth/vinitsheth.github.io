### Who am I

My name is Vinit Sheth. I am a master student in the Department of Computer Science at Arizona State University. My research interests are mainly in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

<br />

I also graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Gujarat Technological University, Ahmedabad, India.
I joined Arizona State University in August 2018 right after graduating from Gujarat Technological University in June 2018. I plan to graduate from ASU in May 2020.

<br />

I am a perfectionist. I want to solve the problems in my hands in perfect ways, which is, however, not achievable in many situations.


<br />

With the help from MOOC, I was able to quickly catch up. I have done a good number of elementary machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence and data science projects indepedently. So I would like to challenge myself more by doing some state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence researches.
